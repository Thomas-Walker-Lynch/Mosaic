Mosaic

A tool to assist in hierarchical white box testing.

Each piece of a program must have integrity for the complete picture to emerge.

With Mosaic we test the pieces, then the communication between the pieces.

Install

After cloning the project, check the tool_shared/third_party directory for
installation instructions for version specific required tools. 

Even if you do not plan to do development or testing on Mosaic, but merely plan
to use the ready made tools found in the release directory, Install RT_incommon
to complete some of the symbolic links and to bring in more documents and
scripts.
