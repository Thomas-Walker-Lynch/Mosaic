General notes on third party tools

A project will have paths and/or symbolic links pointing into the third party
tools, so as to make use of them.  

The contents of the third_party directory is .gititnored, though the upstream
directory has its own gitignore.

If you already have the project installed, perhaps because you
are working on it, then a new install is not needed, rather the
existing install can be linked, for example for RT-project-share:

  ln -snf ~/RT-project-share "$REPO_HOME"/tool_shared/third_party

Otherwise, follow the directions below to make a local
install of the third party tool.
