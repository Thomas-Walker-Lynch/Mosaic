For mucking around with the tools install and config, cd to the top of
the project and source the env_administrator environment.

  git clone <project>
  cd project
  source env_administrator

General notes on third party tools

A project will have paths and/or symbolic links pointing into the third party
tools, so as to make use of them.  

The contents of the third_party directory is .gititnored, though the upstream
directory has its own gitignore.

If you already have the project installed, perhaps because you
are working on it, then a new install is not needed, rather the
existing install can be linked, for example for RT-project-share:

  ln -snf ~/RT-project-share "$REPO_HOME"/tool_shared/third_party

Otherwise, follow the directions below to make a local
install of the third party tool.

----------------------------------------
RT-project-share 

This pulls in documents and commonly used scripts. The project has symbolic links
into RT-icommon, so this is not optional.

  cd "$REPO_HOME/tool_shared/third_party/"
  git clone https://github.com/Thomas-Walker-Lynch/RT-project-share.git

  note this link should already be present:
    ln -s "$REPO_HOME/tool_shared/third_party/resource/document" see_also

jdk-23

  cd "$REPO_HOME/tool_shared/third_party/upstream"

  edit $REPO_HOME/tool_shared/bespoke/env, and update JAVA_HOME:
    export JAVA_HOME="$REPO_HOME/tool_shared/third_party/jdk-23.0.1"

IDE

See
$REPO_HOME/tool_shared/document/install_emacs.txt
$REPO_HOME/tool_shared/document/install_IntelliJ_IDEA.txt


but a local install of an IDE will assure it is
sync with the rest of the project build for configuration files and tools built
in to it.

See the install_emacs.txt and/or install_IDEA.txt files. 

Note, I am using emacs mainly, but also configured and ran IntelliJ IDEA to make
sure it was working.
