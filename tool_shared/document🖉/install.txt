env_administrator

For mucking around with the tools install and config, cd to the top of
the project and source the env_administrator environment.

  git clone <project>
  cd project
  source env_administrator

----------------------------------------
RT-incommon 

This pulls in documents and commonly used scripts. The project has symbolic links
into RT-icommon, so this is not optional.

  cd "$REPO_HOME/tool_shared/third_party/"
  git clone https://github.com/Thomas-Walker-Lynch/resource.git
  ln -s "$REPO_HOME/tool_shared/third_party/resource/document" see_also

----------------------------------------
jdk-23

  cd "$REPO_HOME/tool_shared/third_party/upstream"

  # source for the 11 version used before, now upgraded to 23
  #curl -C - -o OpenJDK11U-jdk_x64_linux_hotspot_11.0.16_8.tar.gz https://github.com/adoptium/temurin11-binaries/releases/download/jdk-11.0.16+8/OpenJDK11U-jdk_x64_linux_hotspot_11.0.16_8.tar.gz
  curl -L -C - -b "oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie" -O https://download.oracle.com/java/23/latest/jdk-23_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz

  cd ..
  tar -xzf upstream/jdk-23_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz

  edit $REPO_HOME/tool_shared/bespoke/env, and update JAVA_HOME:
    export JAVA_HOME="$REPO_HOME/tool_shared/third_party/jdk-23.0.1"

----------------------------------------
IDE

This is not strictly necessary, but a local install of an IDE will assure it is
sync with the rest of the project build for configuration files and tools built
in to it.

See the install_emacs.txt and/or install_IDEA.txt files. 

Note, I am using emacs mainly, but also configured and ran IntelliJ IDEA to make
sure it was working.
