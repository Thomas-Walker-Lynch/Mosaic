The project is originally configured to be used with Emacs as an IDE. The tools
can all be run from a shell inside of emacs. Even when using an IDE what the
shell environment scripts and tools do should be understood.

I have added a working IntelliJ IDEA configuration, so if you want a modern IDE
it is probably best to go with this. See ItelliJ_IDEA.txt in this directory.

I've not run Eclipse on the project, if you do, perhaps you can update the notes
here.  These things will probably increase your odds of making it work:
  1. open a shell
  2. cd to Ariadne, and source the env_developer
  3. run the tool 'distribute_source'
  3. run eclipse from the command line
  4. give eclipse the 'scratchpad' directory as its source

Be sure to run `release` after development to update what the tester sees.

Do the analogous steps if you contribute as a 'tester'.  I.e. from
the shell source env_tester instead. Also, you will need to add
distribute_source to tester/tool, as it is currently not there.
