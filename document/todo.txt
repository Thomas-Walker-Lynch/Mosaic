Updates for Ariadne

1. reflect project skeleton changes.
   replaced literal `Ariadne` with `$PROJECT`
   in top level env choices, PROJECT -> PROMPT_DECOR

   note in 'release' there is a variable name with the project name embedded in it:
   Ariadne_jar_fp -> project_jar_fp
   Change slashes to dots in the wrapper maker of 'make'

2. should do something about `wrapper` as it appears in multiple places making
   editing it a pain.
   in all places `wrapper` appears, now calls `shell_wrapper_list`
   in both developer and tester

3. clean_make -> clean_make_output

4. version outputs a `v` in front of the number

5. fix many shebangs to be: #!/usr/bin/env bash

6. scratch_pad -> scratchpad

5. make_source_tree also integrated into make

6. replacement for bespoke/env and all other env files, related document.
