1. More languages support, notably nodejs.

2. This message:

    Running Test_File_0...Structural problem: unpack_file_path_0 does not accept a single IO argument.
    Error: unpack_file_path_0 has an invalid structure.

  Perhaps only the second one, getting rid of 'Error:'

    "Bad type signature for method: unpack_file_path_0 does not accept a single IO argument."

3. TestBench -> Testbench perhaps?

4. fix emacs.el so that jdbx doesn't always start with Test_Util.  (note the
   prior start can be found with M-x p


5. should include a tool for aggregating test suite runs
    FYI, I'm using 

6. need an example .bashrc for setting the prompt now that I removed references
to the 'resource' project and plan to deprecate it.

7. should check stdin for unused input and report error also.

8. move 'unlock_class` from Ariadne tests to Mosaic_Util.

9. consider adding Maven for the third party tools dependencies.

10. really should move the developer/release 'install' script to the bespokeðŸ–‰/env script

  Gives an error, but still passes? Is this right?

  Java has a love-hate-relationship with reflections ability to access
  private methods; however, access is needed for white box testing.  It
  might be in the future for this feature to work that the Mosaic
  project will have to expanded into the same module as that being
  tested, rather than having its jar file accessed through the class
  path.

  FunctionSignature used with AllMethodsPublic currently does not
  include the return type. It needs to have that.
