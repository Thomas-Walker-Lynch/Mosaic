predicate == is_well_formed_q

We can not check that the node labels are unique because the given value
is a single node, and the code is stateless. Besides there is no contract with
the programmer on how to use the predicated, so the programmer could call the
predicate multiple times on the same node.  Now can we test this condition in
our do_markup_graph routine because of the way lookup works, it will always
return the same node for the same label.  This would be a truly difficult check
to perform because the map does not given an error but just takes the second of
the duplicate key definitions (is this really true?)  besides, it would require
a formal proof of the recognizer functions that they do not return different
definitions for different keys to match regexprs against.  I've been mulling
this over.  As we currently the programmer provides the map and function
definitions, we don't even know which nodes will be in the graph...
